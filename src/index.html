			<h1>Overnight, Refrigerator Focaccia = The Best Focaccia Bread Recipe</h1>
			<p>Cold, refrigerated dough is the secret to making delicious focaccia! Allowing the dough to rest 18 to 48
				hours
				in
				the
				fridge will yield extra-pillowy and airy focaccia, though if you are pressed for time, you can make this
				start-to-finish in 3 hours. This 4-ingredient recipe requires only 5 minutes of hands-on time. Video

			<p>I've said it before and I'll say it again: focaccia is the bread recipe for beginners. Why? Because:
				The no-knead, 4-ingredient dough takes 5 minutes to mix together.
				It requires no special equipment, no tricky shaping technique, and no scoring.
				If you have a 9x13-inch baking pan and your fingertips (for dimpling), you're good to go.
				It emerges soft and pillowy, olive oil-crusted, golden all around, and it's completely irresistible.</p>
			<p>In sum, it's hard to beat focaccia in the effort-to-reward category. If you are intimidated by bread baking,
				this
				is the recipe I suggest making first, both for its simplicity and flavor. After all, this focaccia bread
				recipe
				is adapted from my <a
					href="https://alexandracooks.com/2012/11/07/my-mothers-peasant-bread-the-best-easiest-bread-you-will-ever-make/">mother's
					simple bread recipe</a>, a recipe that has removed the fear of the bread baking
				process for many.</p>

			<h2>Two Secrets for the Best Focaccia</h2>
			<p>This focaccia emerges from the oven golden all around and pillowy inside, its surface dimpled with deep
				crevices,
				namely for two reasons:
				High hydration dough. This focaccia is 88% hydration.
				Long cold slow fermentation. This dough ferments in the fridge for at least 12 hours or for as long as three
				days.
			</p>
			<p>Let's explore each reason:
				A high-hydration dough is a dough with a high proportion of water relative to the flour. A high proportion
				of
				water will create a light and air dough and ultimately a focaccia with beautiful air pockets throughout.
				(Incidentally, this is the secret to making excellent <a
					href="https://alexandracooks.com/2019/01/31/homemade-pizza-dough-recipe/">pizza dough</a>, too.)
				A cold fermentation is beneficial to dough because it slows the fermentation process down and during this
				long,
				cold fermentation, enzymes in both the flour and the yeast break down the starches in the flour into simple
				sugars. These sugars contribute both to flavor and to browning. Cool, right?

				Furthermore, a long slow fermentation strengthens gluten, which will further promote a crumb structure with
				lots
				of air pockets throughout.</p>
			<h2>How This Focaccia Recipe Differs from Others</h2>
			<p>There are lots of focaccia bread recipes out there, so why make this one? This one differs from many of the
				recipes out there in two ways:
				The long, cold, refrigerator rise.
				The absence of sugar or honey or any sort of sweetener.

				Why isn't there any sweetener in this recipe? Simply stated, a sweetener is just not needed — the yeast,
				contrary
				to popular belief, does not need sugar to activate or thrive. Sugar will speed things up, but when you're
				employing a long, slow rise, speed is not the name of the game.
				As noted above, during the long, cold fermentation, enzymes in both the flour and the yeast will break down
				the
				starches in the flour into simple sugars, which will contribute both to flavor and to browning, rendering
				sugar
				unnecessary.</p>
			<h2>Four Tips for Success</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Allowing the dough to rest 18 to 24 hours in the fridge yields the best results. (You can leave the
					dough
					in the fridge for as long as 72 hours.)</li>
				<li>A buttered or parchment-lined pan in addition to the olive oil will prevent sticking. When I use Pyrex
					or
					other
					glass pans, butter plus oil is essential to prevent sticking. When I use my <a
						href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029JOC6I/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=alexandrask06-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B0029JOC6I&linkId=6c471392704f4c358740f5edc8c469ad">9x13-inch
						USA Pan</a>, I can get away with
					using olive oil alone.</li>
				<li>Count on 2 to 4 hours for the second rise. This will depend on the temperature of your kitchen and the
					time
					of
					year.</li>
				<li>After the second rise, dimple the dough, then immediately stick the pans in the oven — this has been a
					critical
					difference for me in terms of keeping those desirable crevices. If you dimple and let the dough rise
					again
					even
					for 20 minutes before popping the pan in the oven, the crevices begin to dissolve</li>
			</ol>
			<h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Flour: bread flour or all-purpose flour will work equally well here. If you live in a humid environment
					or
					abroad,
					I suggest trying to get your hands on bread flour. King Arthur Flour is my preference.</li>
				<li>Yeast: <a
						href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00V7F5OPI/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=alexandrask06-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00V7F5OPI&linkId=2aad5482d3651f965ddd831c0adadfd0">SAF
						Instant Yeast</a> is my preference, but active dry yeast works just as well. See recipe box for
					instructions
					on
					how to use active-dry yeast in place of instant.</li>
				<li>Salt: I say this all the time, but a big part of making a good loaf of
					bread comes down simply to using the right amount of salt given the amount of flour you are using by
					weight.
					It's
					like anything: bread has to be well seasoned. At a minimum, use 10 grams (2 teaspoons) of salt for every
					500
					grams
					(4 cups) of flour. I highly recommend investing in some <a
						href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00017028M/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=alexandrask06-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00017028M&linkId=43ecef11219dcacb2a1681c0fd0fe246">good,
						flaky sea salt</a> for sprinkling on top of the focaccia
					dough — it tastes better
					than the more finely ground varieties of salt. I use Diamond Crystal kosher salt for the dough, but any
					salt
					you
					have on hand will work just fine for the dough.</li>
				<li>Water: There is a lot of water in this dough — it's 88% hydration — and all of that water helps produce
					a
					light,
					airy, pillowy dough.</li>
				<li>Olive oil: Olive oil both in the bottom of the pan and on top of the dough is essential for encouraging
					nice
					browning, flavor, and that quintessential oiliness we all love about focaccia</li>
				<li>Rosemary or other seasonings: Rosemary is a classic focaccia topping, and you can either sprinkle it
					over
					the
					dough before baking or you can chop it up and add it to the dough. Many people love sun-dried tomatoes
					and
					olives
					in their focaccia. <a

			<h2>How to Make Focaccia Bread, Step by Step</h2>
			<p>Gather your ingredients: 4 cups (512 g) flour, 2 teaspoons (10 g) salt, 2 teaspoons (8 g) instant yeast (<a
					href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001CXUHW/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=alexandrask06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B0001CXUHW&linkId=a56a3fecda2ab41dde8f5206bc153a57&th=1">SAF</a>
				is my preference), 2 cups (455 g) water:</p>
			<img src="images/ingredients_alexandraskitchen-1.jpg" />
			<p>Whisk together the flour, salt, and yeast first:</p>
			<img src="images/whiskeddryingredients_alexandraskitchen.jpg" />
			<p>Add the water:</p>
			<img src="images/addingthewater_alexandraskitchen.jpg" />
			<p>Use a spatula to stir the two together.</p>
			<img src="images/mixeddough_alexandraskitchen.jpg" />
			<p>Slick the dough with olive oil…</p>
			<img src="images/oilcovereddough_alexandraskitchen.jpg" />
			<p>… then cover the bowl preferably with a <a
					href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QODRF0/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=alexandrask06-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B000QODRF0&linkId=dcce0954998f86b4c4049b58a2831c49&th=1">lid</a>
				or a cloth bowl cover. Stick the bowl in the fridge immediately; leave it there to rise for 12 to 18 hours
				(or
				for as long as three days).</p>
			<img src="images/bowlcovered_alexandraskitchen.webp" />
			<p>NOTE: It is important the dough really be slicked with olive oil especially if you are using a cloth bowl
				cover
				or tea towel as opposed to plastic wrap or a lid. If you are using a tea towel, consider securing it with a
				rubber band to make a more airtight cover. If you do not slick the dough with enough oil, you risk the dough
				drying out and forming a crust over the top layer.</p>
			<img src="images/bowlcover_alexandraskitchen.webp" />
			<p>Remove from fridge, and remove the cover:</p>
			<img src="images/afterfridgerise.jpg" />
			<p>Deflate the dough and transfer to a prepared pan. I love this <a
					href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029JOC6I/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=alexandrask06-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B0029JOC6I&linkId=067c4fd00f10ab2927503bd1e2e8e96c">9x13-inch
					USA pan</a>. If you don’t have one you can use two 8- or 9-inch pie plates or something similar. If you
				are
				using glass baking dishes be sure to grease the dishes with butter before pouring a tablespoon of olive oil
				into each. (The butter will ensure the bread doesn’t stick.) Don’t touch the dough again for 2 to 4 hours
				depending on your environment.</p>
			<img src="images/doughinpanafterovernightrise_alexandraskitchen.webp" />
			<p>After two to four hours, or when the dough looks like this…:</p>
			<img src="images/doughrisen_alexandraskitchen.webp" />
			<p>… it’s time to dimple it! You can simply use olive oil and salt — I recommend <a
					href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00017028M/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=alexandrask06-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00017028M&linkId=43ecef11219dcacb2a1681c0fd0fe246">good,
					flaky sea salt</a> for this. Note, the dough in the photo below spent three days in the fridge, and the
				dough
				was super bubbly!</p>
			<img src="images/dimpledfocccia_alexandraskitchen.webp" />
			<p>if you are using rosemary, sprinkle it over the dough. Then pour two tablespoons of olive oil over the

				is great here.</p>
			<img src="images/unbakedfocaccia_alexandraskitchen-1.jpg" />

			<h2>How to Incorporate Rosemary, Herbs, and Other Ingredients & Toppings into Your Focaccia Dough</h2>
			<p>One of the most frequently asked questions I get is: How can I add other toppings or ingredients to my
				focaccia
				bread? You can do this in two ways:</p>
			<p>1. Add them on top as you would rosemary or other herbs. The key is to make sure the ingredients are slicked
				lightly with olive oil to ensure they do not burn in the oven. I like to sprinkle the rosemary over top of
				the
				dough, then drizzle it with olive oil, then dimple the dough.</p>
			<p>2. You can add them directly to the dough. In step one, when you whisk together the flour, salt, and instant
				yeast, add your ingredients — chopped olives, sun-dried tomatoes, roasted garlic — to the flour and toss to
				coat; then add the water.</p>

			<h2>How to Make Focaccia Bread Art</h2>
			<p>Pictured above is my “Ode to Spring” (🤣) Focaccia Bread Art (or Garden Scape). As noted above, the key with
				adding toppings is to slick them lightly with olive oil to ensure they don't completely char. Keep in mind
				that
				some items will char, and a little charring is not a bad thing.</p>
			<h3>To make a focaccia bread art:</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Follow the recipe through the step in which you dimple the dough just before baking. Arrange your
					toppings
					—
					sliced peppers, asparagus, scallions, olives, tomatoes, onions, etc. — over top and dimple again,
					pressing
					the
					ingredients into the dough to embed them — you can be more aggressive than you think.</li>
				<li>Brush the entire surface with olive oil; then sprinkle with sea salt.</li>
				<li>Bake as directed.</li>

			<h2>Can I Make this Overnight Focaccia Without the Overnight Rise?</h2>
			<p>Yes, you can. In fact, in my cookbook, <a
					href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/055345983X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=alexandrask06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=055345983X&linkId=8cdaf3bc2ae744c010a642c8d2759bc4">Bread
					Toast Crumbs</a>, I do not employ an overnight rise. Start-to-finish it can be made in about three hours.
				The finished bread will not be as pillowy, but it will still be light, airy, and delicious.
				To skip the overnight rise, simply let the mixed dough rise at room temperature until doubled, about 1.5 to
				2
				hours. Then proceed with the recipe, knowing the second rise will only take about 30 minutes.</p>

			<p>A few notes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Plan ahead: While you certainly could make this more quickly, it turns out especially well if you mix
					the
					dough
					the day before you plan on baking it. The second rise, too, takes 2 to 4 hours.</li>
				<li>If you are short on time and need to make the focaccia tonight: Let the mixed dough rise at room

			<h3>Instructions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Make the dough: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and instant yeast. Add the water. Using
					a
					rubber spatula, mix until the liquid is absorbed and the ingredients form a sticky dough ball. Rub the
					surface
					of the dough lightly with olive oil. Cover the bowl with a damp tea towel, cloth bowl cover, or plastic
					wrap
					and place in the refrigerator immediately for at least 12 hours or for as long as three days. (See notes
					above
					if you need to skip the overnight rise for time purposes.) NOTE: It is important the dough really be
					slicked
					with olive oil especially if you are using a cloth bowl cover or tea towel as opposed to plastic wrap or
					a
					hard
					lid. If you are using a tea towel, consider securing it with a rubber band to make a more airtight cover.
					If
					you do not slick the dough with enough oil, you risk the dough drying out and forming a crust over the
					top
					layer.</li>
				<li>Line two 8- or 9-inch pie plates or a 9x13-inch pan (see notes above) with parchment paper or grease
					with
					butter or coat with nonstick cooking spray. (Note: This greasing step may seem excessive, but with some
					pans,
					it is imperative to do so to prevent sticking. With my USA pans, I can get away with olive oil alone;
					with
					my
					glass baking dishes, butter is a must.)</li>
				<li>Pour a tablespoon of oil into the center of each pan or 2 tablespoons of oil if using the 9x13-inch pan.
					Using two forks, deflate the dough by releasing it from the sides of the bowl and pulling it toward the
					center.
					Rotate the bowl in quarter turns as you deflate, turning the mass into a rough ball. Use the forks to
					split
					the
					dough into two equal pieces (or do not split if using the 9x13-inch pan). Place one piece into one of the
					prepared pans. Roll the dough ball in the oil to coat it all over, forming a rough ball. Repeat with the
					remaining piece. Let the dough balls rest for 3 to 4 hours depending on the temperature of your kitchen
					(Note:
					no need to cover for this room temperature rise).</li>
				<li>Set a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat it to 425°F. If using the rosemary, sprinkle it over
					the
					dough. Pour a tablespoon of oil over each round of dough (or two tablespoons if using a 9x13-inch pan).
					Rub
					your hands lightly in the oil to coat, then, using all of your fingers, press straight down to create
					deep
					dimples. If necessary, gently stretch the dough as you dimple to allow the dough to fill the pan.
					Sprinkle
					with
					flaky sea salt all over.</li>
				<li>Transfer the pans or pan to the oven and bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until the underside is golden and
					crisp.
					Remove the pans or pan from the oven and transfer the focaccia to a cooling rack. Let it cool for 10
					minutes
					before cutting and serving; let it cool completely if you are halving it with the intention of making a
					sandwich.</li>
				<li>To store the focaccia: When it has completely cooled, transfer it to an airtight bag or vessel and store
					it
					at
					room temperature for up to 3 days. Otherwise, freeze it for up to 3 months. Always reheat it on
					subsequent
					days
					to revive its crust: 350ºF for 15 minutes.</li>
